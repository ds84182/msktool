/**
 * Adjust the color of the [src] image using varous color transformations.
 *
 * [blacks] defines the black level of the image, as a color.
 *
 * [whites] defines the white level of the image, as a color.
 *
 * [mids] defines the mid level of hte image, as a color.
 *
 * [contrast] increases (> 1) / decreases (< 1) the contrast of the image by
 * pushing colors away/toward neutral gray, where at 0.0 the image is entirely
 * neutral gray (0 contrast), 1.0, the image is not adjusted and > 1.0 the
 * image increases contrast.
 *
 * [saturation] increases (> 1) / decreases (< 1) the saturation of the image
 * by pushing colors away/toward their grayscale value, where 0.0 is grayscale
 * and 1.0 is the original image, and > 1.0 the image becomes more saturated.
 *
 * [brightness] is a constant scalar of the image colors.  At 0 the image
 * is black, 1.0 unmodified, and > 1.0 the image becomes brighter.
 *
 * [gamma] is an exponental scalar of the image colors.  At < 1.0 the image
 * becomes brighter, and > 1.0 the image becomes darker.  A [gamma] of 1/2.2
 * will convert the image colors to linear color space.
 *
 * [exposure] is an exponental scalar of the image as rgb * pow(2, exposure).
 * At 0, the image is unmodified; as the exposure increases, the image
 * brightens.
 *
 * [hue] shifts the hue component of the image colors in degrees.  A [hue] of
 * 0 will have no affect, and a [hue] of 45 will shift the hue of all colors
 * by 45 degrees.
 *
 * [amount] controls how much affect this filter has on the [src] image, where
 * 0.0 has no effect and 1.0 has full effect.
